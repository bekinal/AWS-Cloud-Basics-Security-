## [AWS Instance Setup](https://github.com/bekinal/AWS-Instance-Setup/blob/main/README.md)
This lab showcases my ability to provision and manage EC2 instances — the backbone of many cloud deployments. Understanding how these systems are deployed and accessed is essential for detecting unauthorized usage, improper configurations, and exposed services.

## [AWS Billing Alert](https://github.com/bekinal/AWS-Billing-Alert/blob/main/README.md)
Abnormal billing spikes can be one of the first signs of account compromise or resource abuse. This lab demonstrates my ability to configure **cost-monitoring alerts** — helping detect crypto-mining activity, unauthorized instance creation, and misuse of cloud resources.

## [AWS IAM Implementation](https://github.com/bekinal/AWS-IAM-Implementation/blob/main/README.md)
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is central to AWS security. In this lab, I implement users, roles, and least-privilege policies — skills that allow me to evaluate access logs, detect privilege escalation, and audit policy misconfigurations.

## [Creating a Virtual Appliance](https://github.com/bekinal/Creating-a-Virtual-Appliance/blob/main/README.md)
This project demonstrates my ability to deploy and integrate security appliances in the cloud. Whether for routing, inspection, or monitoring, virtual appliances are critical for cloud detection and response strategies, and understanding how to deploy them is key to effective alerting.

## [Amazon Security Groups](https://github.com/bekinal/Amazon-Security-Groups/blob/main/README.md)
Security groups act as stateful firewalls in AWS. This lab shows my understanding of **cloud perimeter defense** by configuring and auditing inbound/outbound rules — vital for spotting misconfigurations, excessive exposure, or attack surface expansion.

## [AWS Organizations Configuration](https://github.com/bekinal/AWS-Organizations-Configuration/blob/main/README.md)
Managing multiple accounts under one umbrella is common in enterprise environments. This lab shows my ability to configure AWS Organizations for **centralized governance**, allowing for better visibility, auditability, and response coordination across business units.

## [AWS WAF Configuration](https://github.com/bekinal/AWS-WAF-Configuration/blob/main/README.md)
Web Application Firewalls are a key defense against injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and bot activity. This lab reflects my understanding of deploying and customizing AWS WAF rules to **detect and block malicious HTTP/S traffic**, a critical responsibility in SOC operations protecting cloud apps.

---

Together, these AWS projects demonstrate my cloud readiness as a SOC Analyst. From cost anomaly detection and IAM hardening to WAF deployment and security group auditing, these labs reflect the breadth of knowledge needed to monitor, defend, and respond to threats in a modern cloud environment.
